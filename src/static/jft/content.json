            "Emotional balance comes with practice in       prayer and meditation.  We get quiet and share our thoughts and hopes and       concerns with the God of our understanding.  Then we listen for guidance,       awaiting the power to act on that direction.",
            "Eventually, our skills in maintaining       near-balance get better, and the wild up-and-down emotional swings we used       to experience begin to settle.  We develop an ability to let others feel       their feelings; we have no need to judge them.  And we fully embrace our own       personal range of emotions."

            "Now that we've finally admitted our insanity and seen examples of it in all its manifestations, we might be tempted to believe that we are doomed to repeat this behavior for the rest of our lives.  Just as we thought that our active addiction was hopeless and we'd never get clean, we might now believe that our particular brand of insanity is hopeless.",
            "Not so!  We know that we owe our freedom from active addiction to the grace of a loving God.  If our Higher Power can perform such a miracle as relieving our obsession to use drugs, surely this Power can also relieve our insanity in all its forms.",
            "If we doubt this, all we have to do is think about the sanity that has already been restored to our lives.  Maybe we've gotten carried away with our credit cards; but sanity returns when we admit defeat and cut them all up.  Perhaps we've been feeling lonely and want to go visit our old using buddies.  Going to visit our sponsor instead is a sane act.",
            "The insanity of our addiction recedes into the past as we begin experiencing moments of sanity in our recovery.  Our belief in a Power greater than ourselves grows as we begin to understand that even our brand of insanity is nothing in the face of this Power."

            "Instead, we try to go about the routine of our lives.  We make meeting attendance and contact with our sponsor top priorities.  Sharing with others about our feelings may let us know we aren't the only ones who have been depressed in recovery.  Working with a newcomer can work wonders for our own state of mind.  And, most importantly, prayer and meditation can help us tap the power we need to survive depression.",

            "We don't need to wait for others to spontaneously offer their insight.  When we spend time with our sponsor or other NA members we trust, we can make the first move and ask them to tell us what they see about particular areas of our lives to which we are blind.  We want a broader vision of our life than just our own; we can have that vision by seeing ourselves through the eyes of others."
